# [Graphically build evaluate machine learning models using SPSS Modeler](https://developer.ibm.com/tutorials/watson-studio-spss-modeler-flow/)

**Learning objectives**

In this workshop, we will explain how to graphically build and evaluate machine learning models by using the SPSS Modeler flow feature in IBMÂ® Watsonâ„¢ Studio. IBM Watson SPSS Modeler flows in Watson Studio provide an interactive environment for quickly building machine learning pipelines that flow data from ingestion to transformation to model building and evaluation, without needing any code. This workshop introduces the SPSS Modeler components and explains how you can use them to build, test, evaluate, and deploy models!ðŸ¤©
